### Hello and welcome!

I'm Pratheek, a curious coder with a journey that has traversed the vast landscapes of the tech world. From being an individual contributor diligently crafting lines of code, to wearing the hat of engineering leadership, and even stepping into the shoes of a founder, I have experienced the myriad challenges, triumphs and failures - ahem - learnings that come with each role.

What truly drives me, however, is the magic of building. I'm drawn to the creation of software products that make a difference, and the possibilities that AI brings to the table are especially thrilling. AI can revolutionize how we work, think and play, which is why a significant chunk of my work orbits around leveraging AI to craft innovative solutions.

Beyond the professional sphere, I am a perpetual tinkerer. The world of technology is vast, and my curiosity is insatiable. Whether it's a new programming language, an emerging tech trend, or just a hobby project I conceived on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I'm constantly on the lookout for new things to learn and create.

So, whether you're here to collaborate, learn, or just take a peek into my world of code and creation, I'm glad you've stopped by. Dive in and let's explore the digital universe together!
