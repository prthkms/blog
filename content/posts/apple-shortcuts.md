## Apple shortcuts that made my life a bit easier

A shortcut is a quick way to get one or more tasks done on your iPhone. Shortcuts can be useful for anything from automating small tasks to performing routine actions or enhance apps with functionality its missing. It employs a drag-and-drop interface which makes it easy for non programmers to get started. For the more advanced stuff, you can combine the power of JS scripting via [Scriptable](https://lex.page/d/0998a344-5e73-4c54-8e11-8c61f58e5810) with Shortcuts and you essentially get a Turing complete system. 

### Exploring My Personal Apple Shortcuts

**1. Turn off Wifi/Bluetooth/Mobile data**

I find it somewhat annoying that iOS does not actually turn off Bluetooth and Wifi when you turn them off from the control center and iOS continues to scan for new devices in the background to support features like Airdrop or Handoff. Apart from the obvious privacy concerns this also also can drain your battery. Therefore, I created a shortcut that completely turns off Wifi, Bluetooth, and Mobile data.

**2. App blocker**

As most people, I found myself reaching for my smartphone far too often. Sometimes its a boring work meeting, sometimes it was to fill the idle 2 mins while I wait for the microwave to heat my food. Instead of blocking an app which usually does not last as I might need that app for something credible, I wanted to put an additional step, a delay that gives me a moment to think if that is what I really want to be doing. 

For this shortcut to work, it should be triggered every time an app is opened, so create a shortcut automation which runs the shortcut everytime the app is opened.

Works for YouTube only but can be easily updated for any app

**3. Whatsapp message without saving number**

It's often that you find yourself needing to send a Whatsapp message to someone without wanting to save their number. Normally, there isn't an easy way to do this as Whatsapp requires you to save their number as a contact first before you can send a message. This can be inconvenient, especially for one-time communications. The shortcut starts a new whatsapp conversation by reading the number from clipboard.

Works for Indian numbers only but can be easily updated for any country code

**4. Shorten URL**

A simple but effective shortcut. When you come across a lengthy URL that you want to share, but it's simply too long and unwieldy, this shortcut comes in handy. It takes the URL from iOS sharesheet, shortens it using a URL shortening service, and then saves the shortened URL back on your clipboard ready to be shared. 

**5. Remove paywall**

A wrapper around [12ft](https://12ft.io/) for reading paywalled content that can be triggered from iOS sharesheet.

Note, this should not be used to avoid paying for content from creators or publications you support. It's simply a tool to access articles on the occasional basis when you're not a subscriber.

These shortcuts have certainly made a difference in my own use of my iPhone, improving both its functionality and my productivity but the real value of Shortcuts doesnâ€™t lie in any single automation, but in the creativity and customization that it affords.

If this piqued your interest you can find many ready to use shortcuts by the community on the shortcut app itself or at [Routine Hub](https://routinehub.co/)
